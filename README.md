// putting a software development team together Called the... 
C++ Software Information Research and Development Buerau ... 
a crack team of loosly held together rouge programmers
With what we lack in skill or organisation or efficiency Value=0
we make up for with sheer hardcore-ness Value=1
often going without sleep or food or proper equipment
making up for it with Ingenuity and Determination..
Also CNS Stimulant ..drugs ,NOOTROPICS And External Graphics processors
System DIY mini ATX frames running SLI TITAN X's and chain vaping } \\

Error=syntax, Debug.exe>> incorrect.syntax>>#:helpme

//
compulsive coding EXCLUSIVELY in C++ Language... 
We are fiercely Anti-Python, Anti-Unity and Anti-Blueprints... 
We are C++ Fanatics building our own softwares and programmes with
Visual Studio, Dev++, OpenGl-ES.. no matter how basic 
its better than selling our souls to Unity for another 
Reboot of Grannny gets her roof retiled or whatever .. 
We will Teardown rebuild our own style on top AND call it our own.. 
even our associated Websites our built with
V8 C++ website development engine so even our Java is c-p-p.\\

I only recently have knuckled down to learn Computer science and programming 
C,C#,C++ Software Development seriously .. 
I am keen obsessive and intelligent.. when I put my mind
to something I do it to the point of insanity and I keep going.. 
not only that but Computer science is my family trade
one of my uncles is the top 10 or 15 people in the world @(CPP)

C language programming  ..
I can go to him with any computing problem or question
and he will know right off the bat! 
my humble development and programming house has some
serious pedigree going for it Value=10000..
